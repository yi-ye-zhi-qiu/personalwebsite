    <p>One of my favorite classes that I took in college was called “Forms of Presence in Renaissance Lyric”, and on sunny Spring afternoons in a room whose windows overlooked the swaying grass of the field outside, we talked about 16th-century poems that arguably form the foundational basis of the great “Western literary canon” (why is this a point of validation for any sort of literary endeavor people make? I don’t know, I just like poems.. in fact, it may be this undying academic respect-for-white-elder-grandad-poets that sustains the systems they create/creating/created, one of which I will soon spend this essay covering)</p>

    <p>While we can busy ourselves talking about metaphor and metonymy as they relate to truth, apostrophe and verb tense as it relates to time and space, in that classroom — and to anyone reading these poems — it is impossible to ignore the heavy-handed obsessive behaviors of misogyny that a lot of these poems adapt, not just when describing any thoughts or feelings toward women, but in fact this frame of toxic masculinity informs how these poets see the world at large: nature becomes feminine, deers and vines and rolling hills all become a part of the reality.</p>

    <p>The point here is that these poems inherit Petrarchism as a style (not exclusively as if the poets are just trying to mimic Petrarch, but it’s a common inspiration), a poetic idiom that a lot of poets after Petrarch imitated. Petrarchism is inherently “male”. In these sorts of poems, women are objects of desire. They rarely speak, they rarely act, except for crucially in denying the satisfaction of their suitors. An example of a theme derived from this is “damsel in distress”, a trope that portrays women as defenseless objects saved by men. It originated from Chaucer’s The Clerks Tale, which was drawn from Petrach. While it is not my goal to trace all forms of incel kingdom back to Petrarchism, as that would imply Petrarchism was the genesis of misogyny (which is far from the truth), or even err to blame Petrarch as if masculinity does not exist all around us, I think it is still — and will remain so for quite some time — crucially important to constantly be talking about how the social construct of misogyny is sewn together. In whatever ways someone can. Part of the perils of the present-day liberal establishment is moving on too fast, and going “out of sight out of mind” on social issues like gender equality, that are omnipresent in American society.</p>
